# NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING-INCORPORATING-USE-OF-BIG-DATA-PROCESSES-AND-TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant attention due to the increasing availability of big data and the need for analyzing large volumes of text data. This methodology report incorporates big data processes and time series analysis in the context of restaurant reviews in Madrid and Paris. The project aims to develop a predictive model for restaurant ratings, explicitly focusing on the year 2019 to understand the pre-pandemic scenario accurately. To begin with, the project leverages the understanding of big data technologies in handling massive volumes and a variety of data collected from the Kaggle website, a popular platform for datasets and any other website. The Madrid and Paris restaurant rating reviews data is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), a scalable and fault-tolerant storage system that can accommodate large datasets efficiently. The data is then loaded into the Jupyter environment using PySpark, which provides a powerful framework for processing big data.

As part of the exploration of different distribution systems, two prominent options were evaluated using YCSB which is an open-source specification and software package for benchmarking NoSQL database management solutions relative performance: MongoDB and MySQL. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format, making it suitable for handling unstructured data like text reviews. It offers flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy adaptation to changing data requirements. In relation to restaurant reviews, MongoDB proves useful for its ability to handle multi-format data and accommodate duplicates and missing values that may be present in the dataset. MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its adherence to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation & Durability) properties and strong consistency. It can efficiently handle transactional systems with well-defined schemas, but it may not be the ideal choice for handling the diverse and unstructured nature of restaurant reviews.

For the big data processing architecture, Lambda Architecture is employed in this project. The Lambda Architecture offers scalability, fault tolerance and supports both batch and incremental updates. It combines batch processing with real-time streaming, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets while providing up-to-date insights. In the context of the restaurant reviews project, this architecture is well-suited to handle continuous data generation and allows for both historical and real-time analysis. HBase, a distributed NoSQL database built on top of Hadoop, can be considered for storing and managing large-scale structured data. It offers efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, making it suitable for specific use cases in big data processing. Other examples of big data structures include Apache Cassandra, Apache Druid, and Apache Flink, each designed to address specific requirements and scenarios.
In conclusion, this methodology report focuses on incorporating big data processes and time series analysis into the field of Natural Language Processing. The project utilizes HDFS for data storage, PySpark for data processing, and Lambda Architecture for efficient analysis. MongoDB and MySQL were explored as distribution systems, with MongoDB proving particularly useful for handling the diverse and unstructured restaurant review data. By leveraging big data technologies and exploring various distribution systems, this project aims to develop a predictive model for restaurant ratings in Madrid, providing valuable insights for the pre-pandemic period in 2019
